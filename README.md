### Hi there 👋

Hi, I’m Boxuan Li. I’m a first-year master's student in bioinformatics at Georgia Tech, and I finished my bachelor's degree in biological science at UC Irvine. My research interest is machine learning in microbiome studies.

- 🔭 I’m currently working in Brown's lab as a Research Technician on a project about comparative genomic analysis on the epidemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in CF patients.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming in bioinformatics and medical microbiology.
- 👯 I’m also interested in the commensal bacteria in CF patients and hope to use machine learning to observe the association between commensal bacteria and CF patients' health status.
