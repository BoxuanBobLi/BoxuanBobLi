### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Boxuan Li. Iâ€™m a first year master student in bioinformatics at Georgia tech, and I finished my bachelor degree in biological science at UC Irvine. My research interest is machine learning in microbiome studies. Now Iâ€™m working with Eli, Bengy and Hrishi on a project about machine learning on the epidemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in CF patients. Iâ€™m also interested in the commensal bacteria in CF patients, and hope to use machine learning to observe the association between commensal bacteria and CF patients' health status.
