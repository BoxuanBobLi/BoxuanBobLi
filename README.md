### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Boxuan Li. Iâ€™m a first-year master's student in bioinformatics at Georgia Tech, and I finished my bachelor's degree in biological science at UC Irvine. My research interest is machine learning in microbiome studies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in Brown's lab on a project about machine learning on the epidemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in CF patients.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming in bioinformatics and medical microbiology.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m also interested in the commensal bacteria in CF patients and hope to use machine learning to observe the association between commensal bacteria and CF patients' health status.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding a 2024 summer internship.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: bli629@gatech.edu or boxuanl4@uci.edu
